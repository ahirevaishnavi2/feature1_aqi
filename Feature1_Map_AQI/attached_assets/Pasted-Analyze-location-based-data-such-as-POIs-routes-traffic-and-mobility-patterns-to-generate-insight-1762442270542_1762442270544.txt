Analyze location-based data such as POIs, routes, traffic, and mobility patterns to generate insights about urban areas. The solution could reveal patterns like “busiest between 6–8 PM” or “quiet zones for evening walks.” Teams can build dashboards or interactive maps with heatmaps and predictive analytics.
